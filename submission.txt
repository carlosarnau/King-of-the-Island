- The main scene to run is "Lobby".
Once in the lobby, you may enter a nickname and the target ip address (if the program is going to be the server, the ip doesn't matter)
Please first startup the server, then the client
Once in game, move the character in the client, and it should appear so in the server. 
(At this moment we don't have a packet limiter, so it's sending so much packets that the server goes slow) >.<
